# weighted-graph-DS
in this project i implemented an undirectional weighted graph data stracture.
it has the ability to add/remove nodes, add/remove edges and more.
forthermore, i implemented a graph algorithms class which, after initialization, can compute shortest path, shortest path distance,
and check if the graph is connected. save, load and deep copy functions included. for more information and bugs reports, contact me at:
